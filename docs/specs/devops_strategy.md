# Deployment and Operations (DevOps) Strategy for ocode Agent Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive DevOps strategy for the ocode agent architecture. As a complex, self-improving AI system comprising multiple interconnected services (Explicit Task Planning, Code Knowledge Graph, and Self-Improvement components), a robust and automated deployment and operations framework is critical. This strategy aims to ensure the reliability, scalability, security, and efficient management of the ocode agent throughout its lifecycle, from development to production.

The goal is to establish a culture and set of practices that enable rapid, reliable, and repeatable delivery of new features and improvements, while maintaining high operational stability and performance. This involves integrating development and operations processes, leveraging automation, and fostering continuous feedback loops.

## 2. Core Principles of DevOps Strategy

Our DevOps strategy will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Automation First:** Automate every possible aspect of the software delivery pipeline, from code commit to deployment and monitoring, to reduce manual effort, minimize human error, and increase speed.
*   **Continuous Everything:** Embrace Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Monitoring (CM) to ensure a steady flow of validated changes and proactive issue detection.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage all infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, configurations) through version-controlled code, enabling reproducibility, consistency, and rapid provisioning.
*   **Observability:** Implement comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing across all components to provide deep insights into system health, performance, and behavior.
*   **Security by Design (DevSecOps):** Integrate security practices and automated checks throughout the entire development and operations lifecycle, rather than as an afterthought.
*   **Resilience & Reliability:** Design for failure, implement self-healing mechanisms, and ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
*   **Scalability & Elasticity:** Architect components to scale horizontally and elastically to meet fluctuating demand and optimize resource utilization.
*   **Collaboration & Feedback:** Foster strong collaboration between development, operations, and AI/ML teams, with continuous feedback loops driving iterative improvements.

## 3. Deployment Models

The ocode agent architecture will primarily leverage containerization and orchestration for deployment, with considerations for specialized environments.

### 3.1. Containerization (Docker)

All ocode agent components (ETP, CKG, PMA, FLL, TGA, KBI, and dynamically generated tools) will be containerized using Docker. This provides:

*   **Portability:** Consistent execution environments across development, testing, and production.
*   **Isolation:** Encapsulation of dependencies and prevention of conflicts between services.
*   **Efficiency:** Lightweight and efficient resource utilization.
*   **Reproducibility:** Ensures that the software behaves consistently regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Each service will have its own `Dockerfile` defining its build process, dependencies, and runtime configuration.

### 3.2. Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)

Kubernetes will be the primary platform for orchestrating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized ocode components in production. Key benefits include:

*   **Automated Deployment & Rollbacks:** Declarative configuration for deploying new versions and automated rollbacks in case of issues.
*   **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** Automatic discovery of services and intelligent distribution of traffic.
*   **Self-Healing:** Automatic recovery from failures (e.g., restarting failed containers, rescheduling on healthy nodes).
*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Dynamic scaling of component instances based on demand and resource utilization.
*   **Resource Management:** Efficient allocation and management of compute, memory, and storage resources.
*   **Secret Management:** Secure injection of sensitive credentials into containers.

Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) will define the desired state of the application, including Deployments, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

### 3.3. Specialized Execution Environments (for Generated Tools)

Dynamically generated tools (from TGA) may require specialized, highly isolated, and resource-constrained execution environments. These will be managed as part of the Kubernetes cluster but with additional security and resource policies.

*   **Sandboxed Pods:** Utilize Kubernetes features like Pod Security Policies, Network Policies, and resource quotas to create secure sandboxes for executing untrusted or experimental generated tools.
*   **Ephemeral Environments:** Generated tools will run in ephemeral environments that are spun up on demand and torn down after execution, minimizing attack surface and resource waste.
*   **Dedicated Node Pools:** Potentially use dedicated node pools for running generated tools to isolate them from core agent services and manage resource contention.

### 3.4. Serverless Functions (for Event-Driven Microservices)

For certain event-driven microservices or specific tasks that are invoked infrequently or have bursty traffic patterns (e.g., webhook handlers, data transformation jobs), serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) may be considered. This offers:

*   **Automatic Scaling:** Scales automatically with demand, down to zero.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead:** No server management required.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-per-execution model.

**Use Cases:**
*   Processing specific events from the asynchronous event stream (e.g., triggering a specific analysis when a new `Error` event is published).
*   Lightweight API endpoints for external integrations.

## 4. CI/CD Pipelines

Automated Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines are fundamental to enabling rapid, reliable, and high-quality software releases for the ocode agent. Separate pipelines will be maintained for core agent components and for dynamically generated tools.

### 4.1. Core Agent Components CI/CD Pipeline

This pipeline will manage the build, test, and deployment of the main ETP, CKG, PMA, FLL, TGA, and KBI services.

*   **Trigger:** Git push to main branch, pull request merges, or scheduled builds.
*   **Stages:**
    1.  **Source:** Fetch code from version control (Git).
    2.  **Build:**
        *   Compile code (if applicable).
        *   Run static analysis (linters, type checkers, security scanners).
        *   Build Docker images for each service.
        *   Tag and push Docker images to a container registry.
    3.  **Test:**
        *   **Unit Tests:** Run comprehensive unit tests for each service.
        *   **Integration Tests:** Deploy services to a temporary test environment (Kubernetes namespace) and run integration tests to verify inter-component communication and functionality.
        *   **Performance Tests:** Basic performance benchmarks to detect regressions.
        *   **Security Scans:** Container image vulnerability scanning.
    4.  **Deploy (Staging):** Automatically deploy validated Docker images to a staging Kubernetes environment.
    5.  **Manual Approval (Optional):** For critical releases, a manual approval step may be required before proceeding to production.
    6.  **Deploy (Production):** Automated deployment to the production Kubernetes environment using rolling updates.
    7.  **Post-Deployment Verification:** Run smoke tests and health checks on the deployed services.

### 4.2. Dynamically Generated Tools CI/CD Pipeline

This specialized pipeline handles the unique requirements of tools generated by the TGA component.

*   **Trigger:** Submission of a `ProposedTool` object by the TGA service.
*   **Stages:**
    1.  **Source:** Retrieve `source_code`, `test_code`, and `ToolSpecification` from the `ProposedTool` object.
    2.  **Build:**
        *   Build a container image for the proposed tool, including its dependencies.
        *   Run static analysis on the generated `source_code`.
    3.  **Test (Sandboxed):**
        *   Deploy the tool to a highly isolated, ephemeral sandbox environment (Kubernetes Pod with strict resource/network policies).
        *   Execute the `test_code` against the generated tool within the sandbox.
        *   Run performance benchmarks and resource consumption tests.
        *   Perform dynamic security analysis (e.g., fuzzing, behavioral analysis).
        *   Capture all stdout, stderr, and resource metrics.
    4.  **Report Validation Results:** Publish `ToolValidationStatus` and `validation_results` back to the KBI service.
    5.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review:** If validation results are below a certain confidence threshold or the tool is deemed critical, a `ToolReviewRequest` is generated in the KBI for human approval. The pipeline pauses until human feedback is received.
    6.  **Integrate/Reject:** Based on validation and HITL review, the tool is either integrated into the agent's active toolset (via KBI) or rejected, with feedback provided to the TGA for iterative improvement.

### 4.3. MLOps Considerations

For components involving ML models (e.g., LLMs used in ETP, AEA, SPI, TGA), the CI/CD pipelines will incorporate MLOps best practices:

*   **Data Versioning:** Track versions of training data used for models.
*   **Model Registry:** Store and version trained ML models.
*   **Model Retraining:** Automated triggers for model retraining based on data drift, performance degradation, or new data availability.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Continuous evaluation of model performance in production against defined metrics.
*   **Feature Store:** Manage and serve features consistently across training and inference.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring and alerting are essential for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of the ocode agent architecture. This involves collecting metrics, logs, and traces, and establishing proactive alerting mechanisms.

### 5.1. Metrics Collection & Visualization

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Monitor critical metrics for each service and the overall system, including:
    *   **System Health:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput, process counts.
    *   **Service Performance:** Request latency, throughput, error rates (HTTP 5xx, gRPC UNKNOWN), queue depths.
    *   **Task Progress:** Number of pending/in-progress/completed/failed tasks, average task duration.
    *   **AI-Specific Metrics:** LLM token usage, API call costs, model inference latency, model drift (for ML components).
    *   **Self-Improvement Metrics:** Number of `FailureAnalysisReport`s generated, `ProvenStrategy` adoption rate, tool generation success rate, HITL review queue length.
*   **Tools:** Prometheus for time-series metrics collection, Grafana for dashboarding and visualization.
*   **Custom Metrics:** Instrument application code to expose custom metrics relevant to business logic and AI-specific operations.

### 5.2. Centralized Logging

*   **Structured Logging:** All services will emit structured logs (e.g., JSON format) with consistent fields (timestamp, service name, log level, request ID, trace ID, message, relevant entity IDs).
*   **Log Aggregation:** A centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Splunk) will aggregate logs from all components, enabling centralized search, analysis, and troubleshooting.
*   **Contextual Logging:** Logs will include correlation IDs (e.g., `task_id`, `attempt_id`) to allow tracing events across multiple services for a single task execution.

### 5.3. Distributed Tracing

*   **End-to-End Visibility:** Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to visualize the flow of requests across multiple services. This is crucial for diagnosing latency issues and understanding complex inter-service interactions.
*   **Span Context Propagation:** Ensure trace and span IDs are propagated across all service calls (gRPC metadata, HTTP headers, Kafka message headers).

### 5.4. Alerting Strategy

*   **Threshold-Based Alerts:** Configure alerts based on predefined thresholds for critical metrics (e.g., CPU > 80% for 5 minutes, error rate > 5% for 1 minute, task queue length > 100).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize machine learning models to detect anomalous behavior in metrics or logs that might indicate emerging issues not covered by static thresholds.
*   **Severity Levels:** Define clear severity levels for alerts (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) and corresponding escalation policies.
*   **On-Call Rotation:** Integrate with an on-call management system (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) to ensure critical alerts reach the appropriate personnel.
*   **Automated Remediation:** For well-understood, low-risk issues, implement automated remediation actions (e.g., restarting a service, scaling up a deployment) triggered by alerts.

### 5.5. Dashboards and Runbooks

*   **Operational Dashboards:** Create intuitive Grafana dashboards for each service and for the overall system, providing real-time visibility into key metrics and logs.
*   **Runbooks:** Develop comprehensive runbooks for common operational issues, guiding on-call engineers through diagnosis and resolution steps. These runbooks will be continuously updated based on post-mortem analyses.

## 6. Scalability and Resilience

The ocode agent architecture is designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and elastic scalability to handle varying workloads and ensure continuous operation.

### 6.1. Horizontal Scalability

*   **Stateless Services:** Where possible, services will be designed to be stateless, allowing them to be scaled horizontally by simply adding more instances. State will be externalized to persistent data stores (e.g., databases, message queues).
*   **Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):** Utilize Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers to automatically scale the number of pod replicas for each service based on CPU utilization, memory consumption, or custom metrics (e.g., task queue length).
*   **Distributed Data Stores:** Employ distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j for CKG) and message queues (Kafka) that can scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes and throughput.

### 6.2. High Availability & Fault Tolerance

*   **Redundancy:** Deploy multiple replicas of each critical service across different availability zones or regions to ensure high availability and protect against single points of failure.
*   **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers (e.g., Kubernetes Services, cloud load balancers) to distribute traffic evenly across healthy service instances and automatically remove unhealthy ones.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Design services to degrade gracefully under heavy load or partial failures, prioritizing critical functionalities.
*   **Circuit Breakers & Retries:** Implement circuit breaker patterns and intelligent retry mechanisms (with exponential backoff and jitter) in inter-service communication to prevent cascading failures and improve resilience.
*   **Leader Election:** For stateful services or those requiring a single active instance, implement leader election mechanisms (e.g., ZooKeeper, etcd) to ensure a primary instance is always available.

### 6.3. Disaster Recovery

*   **Cross-Region Replication:** Critical data stores will be replicated across multiple geographic regions to protect against regional outages.
*   **Backup and Restore:** Implement automated backup and restore procedures for all persistent data, with regular testing of recovery processes.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Define clear RTO and RPO targets for each service and the overall system, and design the disaster recovery strategy to meet these objectives.

### 6.4. Resource Quotas and Limits

*   **Kubernetes Resource Management:** Define resource requests and limits (CPU, memory) for all pods in Kubernetes to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair sharing of cluster resources. This is especially important for dynamically generated tools running in sandboxes.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Continuously monitor resource utilization and optimize resource allocation to balance performance with cost efficiency.
